# 1. Wordle Clone

I made a clone of the popular New York times game, Wordle. You can access the game at [wordle.ronakvyas.com](http://wordle.ronakvyas.com).

You can see the source code on my Github: [https://github.com/ronaksvyas/wordle](https://github.com/ronaksvyas/wordle). 

Please raise an issue if you find one on this repository.

It is made using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and a public API for getting new words and checking it in the dictionary. I hosted it using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)(it is amazing).
