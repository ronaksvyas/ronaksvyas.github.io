Butterflies, Turtles and Fish  
Sketching, Scribbling and Food  
Toddlers, Pugs and an endless wish,  
For now are good.

All you need is,  
A reason to live  
A pleasant high  
A crying eye  
A deep dive  
Being alive  
A beehive  
A kidâ€™s smile  
A deep fry  
Throat dry  
A sweet lie  
A long drive  
All these are good enough  
Reasons to live
